## Avoid too much unnecessary PR descriptions

When creating PRs description, please avoid unnecessary details in the context of conda-forge.

For example, instead of:

~~~
Fixes #114

This PR adds a dedicated `mujoco-sysid` output to map the upstream `mujoco[sysid]` extra into conda-forge package outputs.

- Adds new noarch output: `mujoco-sysid` (`noarch: python`)
- Uses conda-forge noarch-python pinning (`python_min`) for host/run/tests
- Depends on `mujoco-python` plus the upstream sysid extra dependencies
- Adds basic tests (`import mujoco` and `pip check`)
- Bumps build number to `1`

This branch is based on the current `conda-forge/mujoco-feedstock` `main` (post-#111).

you should write:

## Avoid \n in PR descriptions and comments

You should always avoid `\n` in comments, for example instead of:

~~~
Opened the required admin-request to allow the new output name:\nhttps://github.com/conda-forge/admin-requests/pull/1908
~~~

you should write:

## If you clone a repo, always download it in this folder

If you clone a repo, always download it in this folder, do not try to find if there is already a clone somewhere else in the system.

## Clearly mark comments and PR descriptions as Agent generated

It is important to avoid mixing comments from the real traversaro user and the one done by an agent. Whenever you are doing a comment yourself, please add a signature of this kind:

~~~
*This comment was generated by an agent (<agent-name>) on behalf of @travesaro . If it looks wrong/sloppy/inappropriate, please report it here: https://github.com/traversaro/conda-forge-agent-ws
~~~
